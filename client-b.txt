Task B: Find the Spot

Start

Define LocationCustomer = Where in the store the customer is located using GPS 
    OR
    Have customer input a location they are near
        Define LocStoreSec_1 = Entrance
        Define LocStoreSec_2 = Exit 
        Define LocStoreSec_3 = Checkout area
        Define LocStoreSec_4 = Restrooms
        Define LocStoreSec_5 = Customer Service

Have customer input what they want to find 
    define locationItem=Item#_location
    define Item#_location by referencing inventory list of itemCode
    Have inventory connected to location in store (aisle and shelving) based on graphed store diagram

Output directions to item from customers location using other locations as nodes
    LocationItem is found at Item#_location
        Define mapdirection
        LOOP
            Utilize Dijkstra's and A* algorithms to decide the quickest route to get from LocationCustomer to LocationItem
                Print string="Go [mapdirection_1, mpadirection_2, mapdirection_3, mapdirection_4] for [distance]."
            If LocationCustomer != locationItem 
                THEN  Utilize Dijkstra's and A* algorithms to decide the quickest route to get from LocationCustomer to LocationItem
                   Print string="Go [mapdirection] for [distance]."
        End Loop when LocationCustomer==locationItem
        Print "[locationItem] has been reached. [locationItem] is located at [Item#_location]."
